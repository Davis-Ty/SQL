# SQL
- This SQL script creates four tables: topEmployee, topSuppliers, fiveBestProducts, and fastestShipper. It then inserts data into these tables.

- Next, it retrieves specific information using SELECT queries:

- The top employee based on the total number of orders placed.
- The top 5 suppliers based on the number of supplied products.
- The top 5 best-selling products along with their categories.
- The fastest shipper with the average delivery time and the number of packages shipped.
- These queries join multiple tables to gather the required data and use functions like COUNT() and DATEDIFF() to calculate relevant metrics.
- Finally, they utilize TOP and ORDER BY clauses to limit and sort the results accordingly.
